# Remote-Monitoring-of-Coke-Cans-in-a-Fridge-using-ESP32
The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way we interact with our surroundings, enabling us to remotely monitor and control various devices. In this project, we will explore the concept of remote monitoring by creating a system to monitor the number of Coke cans in a fridge using the ESP32 microcontroller and the Blynk mobile app.

Imagine having the ability to check the availability of your favorite beverage without opening the fridge door. This project allows us to accomplish precisely that by utilizing the ESP32 microcontroller, which provides built-in Wi-Fi connectivity, and the Blynk app, which offers an intuitive platform for creating IoT applications.

The main objective of this project is to build a smart monitoring system that detects and tracks the number of Coke cans in a fridge. By connecting the ESP32 to sensors inside the fridge, we can monitor the number of cans in real time and visualize the data on our smartphones using the Blynk app.

This project not only enhances our understanding of IoT concepts but also provides hands-on experience with the ESP32 microcontroller, sensor integration, and mobile app development. Through the process, we will gain proficiency in programming the ESP32, working with sensors, and creating a user-friendly interface using the Blynk app.

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the hardware setup, software configuration, and coding steps required to implement the remote monitoring system. We will cover topics such as connecting sensors to the ESP32, establishing Wi-Fi communication, integrating with the Blynk app, and displaying the real-time data.

Upon completion, you will have a fully functional system that wirelessly monitors the Coke cans in your fridge, allowing you to check their availability at any time through the Blynk app. Moreover, this project will serve as a solid foundation for exploring and creating other IoT applications.

So, let's dive into the exciting world of IoT, ESP32 microcontrollers, and the Blynk app, and develop our skills in remote monitoring while revolutionizing the way we interact with everyday objects.
